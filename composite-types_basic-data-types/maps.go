// Maps in go are similar to hashes in 
// ruby or python or objects in javascript.

// Maps are declared with the following syntax:
// map[keyType]valueType

var newMap = map[string]int{
	"key1": 1,
	"key2": 2,
}

// To read or write to a map, you can use the following
// syntax:

// newMap["key1"] - reads the value

// newMap["key1"] = 3 - writes the value. Can also
// be used to create new key value pairs in the map

// the zero value of map is nil

var nilMap map[string]int

// This is different than an empty map literal:

var notNil = map[string]int{}

// both have a length of zero, but we can read and
// write to notNil. We cannot read or write to nilMap

// Example of creating a map of slices:

var sliceMap = map[string][]string{
	"Names": []string{"Kevin", "Julia", "Aaron"},
	"Animals": []string{"Dog", "Cat", "Human"},
}


// If you know how many key-value pairs you intend to put in the map, but donâ€™t know the exact values, you can use make to create a map with a default size:

var ages = make(map[int][]string, 10)
// Maps created with make still have a length of 0, and they can grow past the initially specified size.

// Maps are like slices in several ways:

// Maps automatically grow as you add key-value pairs to them.

// If you know how many key-value pairs you plan to insert into a map, you can use make to create a map with a specific initial size.

// Passing a map to the len function tells you the number of key-value pairs in a map.

// The zero value for a map is nil.

// Maps are not comparable. You can check if they are equal to nil, but you cannot check if two maps have identical keys and values using == or differ using !=.

// Note that reading from a map is not 0(1). Maps
// in go are set up as hash maps, and are actually
// arrays. The hash map uses a hashing algorithm
// to convert the key in the map into a number, which
// is then used to index into the array. Different
// keys can result in the same number. 
// 
// At the specified index in the array, a "bucket"
// (also an array) stores both the key and value. 
// A bucket can hold multiple keys and values.
// When reading from a map, the key is converted
// into a number, the index is found with that number
// and then all the keys in the bucket are iterated over
// until the correct one is found.

// Two keys mapping to the same bucket is known
// as a "collision" - it's best to avoid collisions
// when possible (they slow things down).


// The comma, ok Idiom

// To check and see if a map has a key inside of it
// we can create two variables whose value
// equals the map accessing the key:

var s, ok = sliceMap["Names"]

// The first variable (s) has the value of the
// value associated with the key in the map,
// or the zero value if there is no key in the map
// that matches the key that has been passed in.

//the second variable (ok by convention) has 
// a boolean value - true if the key is present,
// false if the key is not present.

// This allows us to distinguish between keys 
// that are not in a map vs. keys whose values
// are the zero value.


// DELETING FROM A MAP
// You can delete a key value pair from a map
// Using the built in delete function:

// delete(sliceMap, "Names")

// The first argument passed in is the map
// the second is the key in the map you want
// to delete.

// Keys in a map must be unique:
//	testMap:=map[string]string{
	// 	"string": "value",
	// 	"string": "value",
	// }
// ^^ This throws an error.

// Using a map as set (data structure of unique values):

// intSet := map[int]bool{}
// vals := []int{5, 10, 2, 5, 8, 7, 3, 9, 1, 2, 10}
// for _, v := range vals {
//     intSet[v] = true
// }
// fmt.Println(len(vals), len(intSet))
// fmt.Println(intSet[5])
// fmt.Println(intSet[500])
// if intSet[100] {
//     fmt.Println("100 is in the set")
// }

// ^^ Converts a slice into a Set by setting
// the map key to the value of the slice and 
// the value associated with the key to true.
// If the key already exists, the value is just
// set to true again - if it doesn't exist, a
// new key/value pair is created.
